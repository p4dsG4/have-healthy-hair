## Project Introduction
An app for those who have concerns about hair and scalp.    
It diagnoses the condition of the scalp based on a photo and recommends appropriate products and clinics.    
It records the condition of the scalp seasonally, allowing tracking by period.
When the records accumulate, it goes further by predicting hair loss in the future.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
